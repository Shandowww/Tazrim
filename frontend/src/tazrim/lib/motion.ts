 *
 *   quick 140ms  press feedback, small popovers (the rail flyout)
 *   fast  240ms  exits, hover, small fades (the card total, notices)
 *   base  380ms  overlays arriving (dialogs, sheets), the tab capsule
 *   page  600ms  a page arriving: the card wallet's spring, the page content
 *                fade, the summary numbers' roll and the charts' entrance all
 *                start together and land on this beat
